## About The Project

Prior to the launch of the NVIDIA 30-Series GPUs (3060, 3070, 3080, 3090) many individuals have been on the hunt to upgrade their PCs‚Äìand with the announcement of the 30-Series release, PC owners now had their eyes on the prize. Unfortunately, due to COVID related issues and more importantly online-scalpers the much anticipated GPUs were gone in seconds upon release.

As NVIDIA and other supporting companies continue to try to recover from this, customers are left with the options of buying the GPUs for resell. Sellers have sold the GPUs from anywhere between $500 over retail to 2x the original amount and beyond.

Many customers, including myself, have been following prices for months; hoping that prices would eventually fall. The downside to this is that there is no real way to track prices unless you write them down every time you check. This can become a drag in the long run and can lead to you to eventually give up on finding one for the right price.

GPU-Please is a simple and efficient way to keep track of gpu prices on Amazon. It is as simple as copying and pasting the Amazon links of the GPUs you are interested in to a text file and running the Python script. From there, the script will organize the data and display it in a .csv file sampled below.

Key Features:
* :white_check_mark: Once you input your links, they stay there forever (unless altered) 
* :white_check_mark: The .csv file displays the date and times at which you run the file, making keeping track easier
* :white_check_mark: Everytime you want to update the .csv, all you need to do is rerun the script

<!-- Getting Started -->
## Getting Started

In order to utilize GPU-Please, please follow the following procedure:

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/waPAO/GPU-Please
   ```
2. Install packages ONE at a time (try 'pip3' if 'pip' fails to work)
   ```sh
   pip install requests
   ```
   ```sh
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```

<!-- Usage -->
## Usage
To use the program on your editor, follow the points below

* You can put your own Amazon links in the "gpu_links.txt" that is in the repo or you can replace the file with a .txt file of your own. 

The text file already contains links to popular 30-Series GPUs, just change as needed. PLEASE paste ONE url per line!

* You may need to adjust the user-agents used when sending the HTTP request depending on your OS and browser. 

Shown below is the headers variable found in the extract_data() function that you shoud edit if needed to. PLEASE leave 'User-Agent' and just touch the value after.

```python
url_headers = ({'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.159 Safari/537.36', 'Accept-Language': 'en-US, en;q=0.5'})
```

[Here](https://developers.whatismybrowser.com/) is a quick and easy way to find common user-agents

* In order to run the script, path to your directory and input the following line in the terminal and run:
   ```sh
   python3 script.py
   ```
   
* Enter in the file name of the text file containing the GPU links
   ```sh
   Please enter the name/path of your ".txt" file: gpu_links.txt
   ```
